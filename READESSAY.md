<h2> Introduction </h2>
</div>

<p>
  The Southern White rhino is a sub-species of rhinoceros native to Southern Africa. The majority of wild African rhinos are being conserved by four range states. These countries include Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa – with South Africa being the home to the largest Southern White rhino population on the continent (IUCN SSC, 2015). However, looking beyond its current thriving population, there is a dark history associated with the Southern White rhino. In the early 20th century, the Southern White rhino only grazed a population of one-hundred individuals. The recovery of its population is a complete contrast to its relative, the Northern White rhino. As the Southern White rhino was experiencing a net increase in population growth, the unfortunate Northern White rhino was following a negative trend in its population growth. The total number of Northern White rhino’s currently rests at 2 individual females, with the last male rhino passing away in 2015. In order to preserve the numbers of Southern White rhinos and prevent the sub-species from replicating the decline of its relative, conservation and protection initiatives have increased in recent decades. This paper will hope to accomplish a thorough discussion on the resiliency of the Southern White rhino population, and how conservation and protection systems have improved its population in the wild.

  Before going straight into the positive influence brought forth by protection and conservation enforcements to population improvement, this paper will also look at complimentary topics to further understand the population rise and  fall of the species. The paper will first look at the socio-economic trends that continue to influence the rise and fall of rhino populations and will then discuss how the reintroduction of the Southern White rhino is important to social and physical landscapes. Within these topics of discussion, this paper will touch on the important points of illegal poaching activity, state reactions, and biological management.

  Some visual representations have been provided to help your understanding of the Southern White rhino’s seemingly global situation. The interactivity in the maps will provide and allow you to visualize the severity at which these efforts in conservation and protection play on a multi-national scale. Moreover, an immersive component has been included in this analysis – a virtual reality A-frame map – serving as an interactive educational exhibit to meet with virtual Southern White rhinoceroses. To also share the importance of an intact habitat, the A-frame virtual reality depicts the conditions of what an African rhinoceros’ habitat should exhibit.

  <h2> Socio-Economic Trends that Correlate to the Population Rise and Fall </h2>
  </div>
  
  <p>
  Poaching is the number one leading cause to the decline of the Southern White rhino. Animal poaching is the illegal slaughter of animals to acquire something the animal possesses that humans consider valuable. For all rhinos and other tusked animals like elephants, their horns/ tusks are their most prominent feature and is also the main reason they are killed. Animal poaching is led by the secret market driving illegal activity that transcends beyond the borders of Africa. Wildlife trade crimes within Africa involves several countries, including South Africa, Mozambique, and the Asian countries of Vietnam and China (IUCN SSC, 2015). Hunting animals for their horns has been a practice for hundreds of years but is the main reason the White Rhino has seen fluctuations in its population. Rhino horns along with other ivory-based products are illegally traded to be transformed into luxury carvings and as ingredients in medicine. Law enforcements on this type of illegal activity has drastically changed, with most countries enforcing imprisonment or monetary sanctions (IUCN SSC, 2015). This transnational attention on animal poaching has influenced the decline in the rhino population but has not eradicated it by any means. Poaching still occurs in almost every part of Africa, and in 2017 alone, South Africa reported the deaths of 1,028 rhinos from poaching activity (Huijbregts, 2019). Another cause to population loss, although less severe in comparison to poaching, is habitat loss. The main reasons to habitat loss include the transformation of land into agricultural land, and the privatization of land for development.
  </p>
  <p>
  The desire of rhino horns and other ivory-based products from international buyers is still an ongoing “black market” business. However, the change in governments to 1) enforce monetary sanctions and 2) imprison the people involved in the poaching process of a wild animals, has helped lower the deaths of Southern White rhinos in this manner. Additionally, community-based conservation organizations in a wide range of African countries, and in-situ conservation guides followed at national scales are influential factors acting against illegal activity. The social desire and economic trade of such products have become less mainstream and thus the illegalization to possess these products has reduced poaching activity. Furthermore, national protected parks play a big part in preventing habitat loss from land transformation and the privatization of land. Key reasons that correlate to the Southern White rhino’s positive net growth in population include, the increased effectiveness of anti-poaching, monitoring and management of populations, and the support from local communities (Huijbregts, 2019).

<h2> Influence on Social and Physical Landscapes </h2>
  </div>
  
 <p>
  Southern White rhinos, like other subspecies of rhinos in Africa are an important animal in African wildlife. Not only do they provide ecological benefits, but they heavily influence the social landscape as well. The four African nations that have significant populations of rhinos include Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa. These are countries heavily involved in the Safari industry and rely on thriving wildlife for traffic in tourism. Africa’s ‘big five’ refer to the leopard, lion, elephant, buffalo and rhino. This term is widely used by African safari tour operators who rely on thriving populations, including the Southern White rhino. Ecotourism is an important source of income for local people, and funds conservation efforts (“African Rhinos”, n.d.). Animal conservation organizations are another opportunity for local engagement. They provide jobs to locals as rangers and surveyors of wildlife. In some cases, like that of the Rhino fund in Uganda – a community-based organization – go beyond their interest of protecting wildlife to financially support schools for local children to attend in the area (DW News, 2018). This represents how wide the role of Southern White rhinos play on a social manner as well. If we allowed the White Rhino population to rapidly decline along with their habitat, local communities will feel the negative effects. 
  </p>
  <p>
  African rhinos are considered to be a keystone species. These are animals that are critical to other species in an ecosystem, and if they were removed there would be a dramatic change in the ecosystem. As important grazer’s consuming large amounts of vegetation, they are important in shaping the environmental landscape (“African Rhinos”, n.d.). Managing plant populations by grazing them doesn’t seem like a significant role for such a large animal, but African rhinos are important players in keeping other plants and animals healthy within a balanced ecosystem. This is why protecting its population and conserving the natural habitat they reside in is not only crucial to supporting the species’ future, and the local communities that rely on their survival, but also goes toward supporting the natural landscape as a whole.

<h2> Conservation and Protection Systems </h2>
</div>

<p>
 The World-Wide Fund for nature, universally known as the WWF, is one of the world’s largest organizations in fighting against the threats to African rhinos. They are highly devoted to strengthening protected areas for African rhinos and work closely with TRAFFIC and the Wildlife Crime Initiative, to reduce the illegal trade of rhino horns (“African Rhinos”, n.d.). The protection and security of the African rhino is taken on by Range State National Plans. These involve the four countries with the most abundant Southern White rhino populations, and other African countries with significant rhino populations of other sub-species. Regarding the transnational issue of illegal rhino horn trade, the African Rhino Conservation Plan aims to “increase sharing of information between range States”, “improve investigative skills”, and enforce on a national scale that “illegal wildlife trade [is] treated as a serious crime” (2016, p.19). These measures spread the message that poaching is not taken lightly. In the African rhino Conservation Plan (2016), range states claim to reduce poaching by reducing corruption in local conservation staff, promote effective crime scene management, and improve investigation skills with more technology. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Biological management is another key component to supporting the survival of African rhinos. This promotes the conservation of genetic diversity and the desire to achieve sustained growth rates across the African landscape, as stated by the African Rhino Conservation Plan (2016). This includes translocation, which aims to reduce densities of well-established rhino populations to facilitate breeding. Breeding is found to be difficult in dense rhino populations because of induced constraints on available food resources, which is why biological management is an important action plan to achieve a positive population growth rate. Translocation is a thoughtful effort to move populations to areas that support them with adequate food resources, and places that comparatively see lower poaching rates. The Rhino fund as mentioned earlier, has established a breeding population of the Southern White rhino in Uganda (DW News, 2018). The objectives of the Rhino fund in Uganda is directly aligned with the global plan to conserve the rhino populations. The Rhino fund runs the rhino re-introduction project in the country and currently holds twenty-two Southern White rhinos in the Ziwa Rhino & Wildlife ranch, a popular destination for tourists (The Rhino Fund Uganda, 2012). The Ziwa Rhino & Wildlife ranch is a sanctuary for a small wild population of Southern White rhinos under the care and management of Rhino fund staff. Although these animals live independently in the wild within the sanctuary’s boundaries, they are heavily monitored for their health and safety.

  Presented above is the sample sanctuary produced to model the proper conditions needed for rhinos. Although the sanctuary is a smaller representation of what sanctuaries exhibit in the real world, the interactive A-frame aims to point out the important role sanctuaries play. Sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers act in managing and caring for vulnerable or recovering populations, and also act as scientific study centers. The Rhino fund of Uganda is one of many African wildlife conservation organizations that protect and care for the unique and diverse landscape Africa has to offer. The threats of poaching and habitat loss are the biggest things these organizations plan to tackle and bring awareness to. With the Northern White rhino going extinct, a handful of African countries are working together to prevent the demise of its Southern White rhino population, by fulfilling the African Rhino Conservation Plan. The maps presented in this essay help to showcase the reality at which poaching is a transnational concern, and how working against poaching affects population growth. The first map shows the countries involved in rhino horn trade, as well as the countries who have active conservation legislation and/or initiatives. The second map helped shed a more positive light on displaying the growth of the Southern White rhino population overtime. The successful net increase of the Southern White rhino over the decades is an example of how these efforts in conservation and protection work, with proper enforcement and collaboration. Although this is a positive message in the case of this sub-species, it’s a constant battle against the human capability to reverse it.
